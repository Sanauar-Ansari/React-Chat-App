A beautiful UI created by React component.

## Features

1) Left sidebar: Show all the contact list with the last message which is created by registering into this App.

2) Search : conversations are searchable by contact name.

I have learned about useState, useEffect, state management tool like Context API,SCSS, and the Firebase.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
